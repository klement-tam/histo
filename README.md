#histo-model

Short for the Hydrogen Infrastructure Spatio-Temporal Optimisation model, this is a predictive model which outputs the most cost-efficient 30-year roadmap for deploying future hydrogen infrastructures (production plants, storage tanks, pipelines etc.) in the United Kingdom's heat network. The mathematical formulation is a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) algorithm.
